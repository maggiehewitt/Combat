 *
 * This class defines a player object; it holds the visual representation of 
 *  the object, as well as the logic for how this object interacts with 
 *  other objects
 *
 * Revision History:
 *   $Log: Player.java,v $
 *   Revision 1.17  2012/04/08 03:50:18  DevA
 *   Cleaned up the code to run with Java 1.6: removed unused imports,
 *   fixed some UI focus issues (introduced by new focus "features" in Java since
 *   our original implementation), and made the CommandInterpreter not a Singleton
 *
 *   Revision 1.16  2003/05/30 19:30:21  DevB
 *   Reformatted.
 *
 *   Revision 1.15  2000/05/11 22:29:40  DevC
 *   comments & cleaning up the code
 *
 *   Revision 1.14  2000/05/11 07:12:04  DevA
 *   Got rid of code that was originally supposed to help cleanup
 *   after a round, but, instead, was just causing a phantom
 *   player to stick around.  (the "last" boolean was useless)
 *
 *   Revision 1.13  2000/05/11 06:29:12  DevA
 *   Removed most debugs from the system and now everything works
 *   great on a New Game or New Round...at least as far as the user
 *   can tell.  I think that whichever Player won a round is left
 *   hanging a bit under the hood.  It never redraws, but it
 *   never really goes away.  Seems like a waste of processor time
 *   so I'm stil trying to figure this out.
 *
 *   Revision 1.12  2000/05/10 22:05:03  DevA
 *   Upped player travel distance.
 *
 *   Revision 1.11  2000/05/10 04:58:33  DevA
 *   Made the amount of travel per tick a class variable so it's easier to change
 *
 *   Revision 1.10  2000/05/09 16:35:27  DevA
 *   Becomes inactive when hit by a bullet.
 *
 *   Revision 1.9  2000/05/09 15:47:39  DevA
 *   Added getDirection
 *
 *   Revision 1.8  2000/05/09 15:26:35  DevA
 *   Fixed moves so that they are based on the correct
 *   origin.
 *
 *   Revision 1.7  2000/05/09 14:57:56  DevA
 *   Registering all moves now and has a stay() method
 *
 *   Revision 1.6  2000/05/09 08:07:46  DevA
 *   Handles a null enemy.
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2000/05/09 06:00:20  DevC
 *   added some missing breaks
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2000/05/09 04:58:04  DevA
 *   Upped move distance.
 *
 *   Revision 1.3  2000/05/08 21:21:44  DevC
 *   did conflict resolution, and implemented
 *   movement methods.
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2000/05/08 04:28:55  DevC
 *   added some code for the conflict resolution;
 *   changed the signature of the move() method
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2000/05/05 21:26:44  DevC
 *   Initial revision
