 * 
 *          This is the Game class...
 * 
 *          Revision History:
 *          $Log: Game.java,v $
 *          Revision 1.26 2012/04/08 03:50:18 DevA
 *          Cleaned up the code to run with Java 1.6: removed unused imports,
 *          fixed some UI focus issues (introduced by new focus "features" in
 *          Java since
 *          our original implementation), and made the CommandInterpreter not a
 *          Singleton
 * 
 *          Revision 1.25 2003/05/30 14:45:00 DevB
 *          Now has a scoreboard that holds the score instead of
 *          the game managing it. It simply tells the score when
 *          and who to increment and when to reset.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.24 2003/05/30 14:27:09 DevB
 *          Changed some formatting.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.23 2000/05/12 04:10:22 DevA
 *          Barriers get cleaned up after a round now. (Using end methods.)
 *          Also fixed a bug I noticed with resetting scores.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.22 2000/05/11 22:44:47 DevA
 *          No point issued if players kill each other at the same time.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.21 2000/05/11 07:12:04 DevA
 *          Resetting scores to zero on new game and made outputs a bit cleaner.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.20 2000/05/11 06:29:12 DevA
 *          Removed most debugs from the system and now everything works
 *          great on a New Game or New Round...at least as far as the user
 *          can tell. I think that whichever Player won a round is left
 *          hanging a bit under the hood. It never redraws, but it
 *          never really goes away. Seems like a waste of processor time
 *          so I'm stil trying to figure this out.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.19 2000/05/10 20:57:54 DevC
 *          added mehod to break down Games into rounds;
 *          added scorekeeping calls and calls for new rounds
 *          after one player wins a round
 * 
 *          Revision 1.18 2000/05/09 18:17:04 DevB
 *          Added the removeAll call again.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.17 2000/05/09 17:40:45 DevA
 *          Added point outputs.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.16 2000/05/09 17:20:22 DevA
 *          Threading support for scoring in place in Game and
 *          PlayerManager.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.15 2000/05/09 16:07:29 DevA
 *          Extended gameLength
 * 
 *          Revision 1.14 2000/05/09 15:26:35 DevA
 *          Taking out debugs.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.13 2000/05/09 14:57:56 DevA
 *          Sending a JPanel to LevelBuilder
 * 
 *          Revision 1.11 2000/05/09 14:05:46 DevC
 *          tracking bugs
 * 
 *          Revision 1.10 2000/05/09 07:28:16 DevA
 *          Just trying to figure out why painting isn't working right.
 *          No real progress.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.9 2000/05/09 05:55:57 DevC
 *          removed the listener from the panel and placed it on the frame
 *          in Combat
 * 
 *          Revision 1.8 2000/05/09 05:31:30 DevA
 *          Actually adding a KeyListener and have isFocusTraversable method
 * 
 *          Revision 1.7 2000/05/09 05:00:16 DevA
 *          Put gameLength back to 2000 everywhere.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.6 2000/05/09 04:11:18 DevA
 *          Pausing and resuming and starting a new game seem to work.
 *          Have things showing now (using jpgs instead of bmps) so shifting
 *          gears to test command interpretation and sprites.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.5 2000/05/08 22:22:29 DevA
 *          Changed buildLevel back to setLevel. Now storing the filename
 *          for the active level and parsing in newGame. Also, newGame
 *          now starts the timer, but that's wrong. Needs to go back
 *          into Combat eventually. Just here for testing since
 *          we're not handling games ending yet anyway.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.4 2000/05/08 20:04:34 DevB
 *          Changed some comments.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.3 2000/05/08 04:18:13 DevB
 *          Conglomerated setLevel and parseLevel into buildLevel
 *          that takes a filename and sets the level to one parsed
 *          by a parser that DevA is writing.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.2 2000/05/08 01:32:33 DevB
 *          Made Game inherit from the JPanel class... it will be
 *          responsible for holding the graphics object (since it is
 *          a panel, that will be its graphic object) that all the
 *          Sprites and board need to draw to.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.1 2000/05/06 19:48:58 DevB
 *          Initial revision
