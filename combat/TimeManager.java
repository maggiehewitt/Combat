 *          Revision History:
 *          $Log: TimeManager.java,v $
 *          Revision 1.10 2003/05/30 19:39:50 DevB
 *          Reformatted.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.9 2000/05/12 00:07:21 DevC
 *          cleanup & comments
 * 
 *          Revision 1.8 2000/05/11 06:29:12 DevA
 *          Removed most debugs from the system and now everything works
 *          great on a New Game or New Round...at least as far as the user
 *          can tell. I think that whichever Player won a round is left
 *          hanging a bit under the hood. It never redraws, but it
 *          never really goes away. Seems like a waste of processor time
 *          so I'm stil trying to figure this out.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.7 2000/05/09 14:05:46 DevC
 *          tracking bugs
 * 
 *          Revision 1.6 2000/05/09 07:58:06 DevB
 *          The removeAll method now works. Wasn't reassigning the
 *          ImmutableList.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.5 2000/05/09 07:18:38 DevA
 *          Just took out a debug.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.4 2000/05/09 03:54:25 DevA
 *          Fixed the loop in run(). No longer while ( !paused ). Instead
 *          while( true) { if (!paused) ...
 * 
 *          Revision 1.3 2000/05/08 22:27:19 DevA
 *          Added sme debugs statements and removeAll.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.2 2000/05/06 19:52:42 DevB
 *          Fixed javadoc class header.
 * 
 *          Revision 1.1 2000/05/06 19:47:19 DevB
