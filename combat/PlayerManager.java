 *
 * PlayerManager class; this class passes ticks, preticks, and commands to the 
 *  players and bullets. 
 *
 * Revision History:
 *   $Log: PlayerManager.java,v $
 *   Revision 1.19  2012/04/08 03:50:18  DevA
 *   Cleaned up the code to run with Java 1.6: removed unused imports,
 *   fixed some UI focus issues (introduced by new focus "features" in Java since
 *   our original implementation), and made the CommandInterpreter not a Singleton
 *
 *   Revision 1.18  2003/05/30 19:48:15  DevB
 *   Reformatted.
 *
 *   Revision 1.17  2000/05/17 16:37:35  DevA
 *   Dynamically deciding what BulletOffset to use
 *
 *   Revision 1.16  2000/05/11 22:12:07  DevC
 *   commented, cleaned up the code & fixed bullet firing
 *   (somewhat; there is a better way to fix it, but
 *   it'd take more time than I have right now)
 *
 *   Revision 1.15  2000/05/11 07:12:04  DevA
 *   Got rid of code that was originally supposed to help cleanup
 *   after a round, but, instead, was just causing a phantom
 *   player to stick around.  (the "last" boolean was useless)
 *
 *   Revision 1.14  2000/05/11 06:29:12  DevA
 *   Removed most debugs from the system and now everything works
 *   great on a New Game or New Round...at least as far as the user
 *   can tell.  I think that whichever Player won a round is left
 *   hanging a bit under the hood.  It never redraws, but it
 *   never really goes away.  Seems like a waste of processor time
 *   so I'm stil trying to figure this out.
 *
 *   Revision 1.13  2000/05/09 16:35:27  DevA
 *   Threaded to wait until it's player has become inactive.
 *   This is the first step in keeping score.  Everytime a PlayerManager
 *   dies, the opposite player's score will be incremented.
 *
 *   Revision 1.12  2000/05/09 16:17:05  DevA
 *   Bullets fire and go in the correct direction :)
 *
 *   Revision 1.11  2000/05/09 15:47:39  DevA
 *   Now bullets fire.  But only once.  Need to fix this.
 *
 *   Revision 1.10  2000/05/09 14:57:56  DevA
 *   Tells a Player to stay() on a tick if now command was
 *  received.
 *
 *   Revision 1.9  2000/05/09 06:08:49  DevC
 *   added check to ensure that a vaible command is given in move
 *
 *   Revision 1.8  2000/05/09 04:48:44  DevA
 *   Debugs and intializing cmds
 *
 *   Revision 1.7  2000/05/09 04:23:24  DevC
 *   fixed initialization errors
 *
 *   Revision 1.6  2000/05/08 22:22:29  DevA
 *   Just made error msg more useful.  "ERROR" now says what
 *   class is having the issue.
 *
 *   Revision 1.5  2000/05/08 21:23:19  DevC
 *   fixed constructor; fixed firing mechanism.
 *
 *   Revision 1.4  2000/05/05 20:53:20  DevC
 *   Made the object timed by implementing the timed interface;
 *   This allows it to get commands on ticks and preticks
 *
 *   Revision 1.3  2000/05/05 04:46:48  DevC
 *   implemented the constructors and logic to call player;
 *   needs only to have exact player calls put in.
 *   Compiles with CI and stub Player
 *
 *   Revision 1.2  2000/05/04 01:21:10  DevC
 *   wrote portions of constructor, a few simple methods.
 *
 *   Revision 1.1  2000/05/04 01:08:11  DevC
 *   Initial revision
